## My Favorite Projects!

### [cTAKES and ScispaCy Entity Extraction](https://github.com/asatpathy314/cTAKES-SciSpaCy-symptom-extractor)
- Description: This program is designed to extract and analyze symptoms and treatments from clinical text documents using two different tools: cTAKES and SciSpaCy. The program includes scripts for data loading, processing, extraction, and validation. It currently supports three different websites' datasets: MayoClinic, ODEMSA, and Wikipedia.
- Technologies Used: Python, Bash, ScispaCy (and spaCy), cTAKES, pandas.

### [TravelSafe](https://github.com/asatpathy314/travel-safe-wics)
- Description: A full-stack web application designed to be a one-stop shop for travel safety information. 
- Technologies Used: pandas, sqlite, Python, Scrapy, Beautiful Soup, Next.js, and TailwindCSS.
- Demo: [Devpost](https://devpost.com/software/travelsafe-d08b45)

### [NER Model Analysis in the EMS Domain](https://github.com/asatpathy314/ner-model-analysis-for-ems)
- Description: A set of generalizable scripts that can be used to validate the performance of medical NER models like ScispaCy and MetaMap.
- Technologies Used: pandas, openpyxl, Python, spaCy.
- Demo: [Presentation](https://github.com/asatpathy314/ner-model-analysis-for-ems/blob/main/2_23_2024%20-%20Link%20Lab%20CogEMS.pdf)

## Honorable Mentions
- [Trivia app](https://asatpathy314.github.io/trivia-app/) I built with React.js with a live demo at the link.
- [Spark](https://github.com/asatpathy314/spark) A full-stack web application built with Next.js, FastAPI, and MongoDB to match high school students with their dream college mentor. (A honorable mention only because we never got a chance to finish the named entity recognition similarity score calculator). :(
- [CTF-Writeups](https://asatpathy314.github.io/ctf-writeups/) Work in progress...
